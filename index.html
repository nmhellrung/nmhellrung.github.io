		<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hi! My name is Nathan Hellrung; I’m a professional computer scientist located in the Austin, TX area currently seeking employment in an entry or junior level position within the field. <br /><br />

			It is with great enthusiasm that I share this portfolio website to any prospective employers and/or hiring managers looking to add a new member to their team; I hope you enjoy this small project, which presents much of the information on my resume, for your consideration. <br />
			As a computer scientist at the graduate level, I believe that the diversity of skills, techniques, knowledge, and experience I have acquired throughout my academic career will allow me to join your esteemed company as an invaluable team member and asset to your business. As seen within my resume, I have had the continuing pleasure of performing as a group leader, helpful teammate, eager learner, and enthusiastic teacher throughout the course of acquiring my associate of science in engineering and bachelor of computer science with minor in applied mathematics degrees, as well as in my numerous graduate courses. On account of these achievements, as well as my ongoing desire for continued learning and growth, I am highly confident in my ability to seamlessly work together to solve problems, deliver consistent and high-quality results, and to ultimately succeed in my position. <br />
			I thrive in environments which reward creativity, critical thinking, analytic ability, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication, and so I am always enthusiastic to hear back regarding opportunities for participating in and contributing to such environments. To reach out to me regarding any work, business, or other official offers, or to ask any questions you might have, please contact me via phone or email using the information given in the “Contact” tab of this web page. <br />
			I would love to be the newest addition to your distinguished business, and eagerly look forwards to hearing from you soon. <br /><br />
			Warmest regards, <br />
			Nathan Hellrung
